# kopForth
My personal portable Forth implementation

The kopForth project (pronounced "cope forth") is intended to be a personal reference subset of a mostly standard-compliant Forth for use in my future projects. It allows for a standardized language that I can easily embed into embedded systems or port to esoteric systems by hand.
